                 A Referee to Authenticate Home Servers
                       draft-xyzzy-referee-latest

Abstract

   Obtaining and maintaining PKI certificates for devices in a home
   network is difficult for both technical and human factors reasons.
   This document describes an alternative approach to securely identify
   and authenticate home servers using a referee system.  The referee
   allows bootstrapping a network of devices by trusting only one system
   in the home network.

1.  Introduction

   Most existing TLS communications require the server obtaining a
   certificate signed by a Certification Authority trusted by the
   client.  Within a home network this is fraught with complications of
   both human factors and technical nature.

   This document describes a Referee system, where a Referee is
   entrusted (once) to help clients identify and authenticate (many)
   servers within the home network.  The Referee system purposefully
   avoids Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 [PKIX].  The TLS
   handshakes only use raw public keys [RFC7250].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Requirements Evaluation

   Using requirements from [I-D.rbw-home-servers], the proposal in this
   document has the following summarized characteristics:

    +==========+========+===========+============+==========+========+
    | Solution | Reduce | Eliminate |  Existing  | Existing | Revoke |
    |          |   CA   |     CA    | CA Support |  Client  |  Auth  |
    |          |        |           |            | Support  |        |
    +==========+========+===========+============+==========+========+
    |  Referee |  Yes   |    Yes    |    N/A     | Some (*) |  Yes   |
    +----------+--------+-----------+------------+----------+--------+

   (*) Support exists in OpenSSL [rpk-openssl] and WolfSSL
   [rpk-wolfssl].

4.  Operation

4.1.  Referee

   The Referee function is implemented within any always-on device
   within the home (e.g., router, smart home hub, NAS).  The Referee
   contains a database of local hostnames and their Referee public key
   fingerprints.

   The Referee on a local network is named "referee.internal".

   Clients authenticate to the Referee using the TLS
   server_certificate_type extension and use HTTP GET to fetch the named
   public key fingerprint from the Referee server.  For example to get
   public key fingerprint of a server named printer.internal,

     GET /.well-known/referee/sha256/printer.internal HTTP/1.1

   The public key fingerprint is SHA-256 of the server's public key
   returned as an octet-stream.

4.2.  Servers

   A server supporting this specification is expected to be a printer
   (using IPPS or HTTPS), NAS, IoT device, router (especially its HTTPS-
   based management console or its ssh server), or similar.

   Each in-home device supporting Referee has a fixed public key, which
   persits for the lifetime of the device.  During installation of the
   device to a Referee network, the device's hostname and public key
   fingerprint are stored into the Referee Server.  Several options
   exist for this step, detailed in Section 5.

   A server supporting this specification needs to support raw public
   keys [RFC7250] and its server_certificate_type extension.  Upon
   receiving a ClientHello with the server_certificate_type extension
   the server responds with its raw public key [RFC7250] rather than a
   PKI certificate.

   If a server's referee public key changes (e.g., factory reset, public
   key algorithm, key length) the new key needs to be enrolled with the
   Referee and the old key removed.  Clients will notice the mis-match
   and will query the Referee.  This functionality might be automated;
   see Appendix A.4.

4.3.  Clients

   A client supporting this specification is first configured with the
   DNS name of its Referee server.  It authenticates to the Referee
   server using one of the bootstrapping mechanisms (see Section 5).
   This step occurs only once for each home network the client joins, as
   each home network is responsible for being a Referee for its own
   devices.

   When connecting to a server with an .internal domain, a client
   supporting this specification includes the TLS
   server_certificate_type extension [RFC7250] in its TLS ClientHello.

   For the client, there are two situations that may occur: it has not
   previously cached the association of hostname to public key or it has
   cached that information.

   *  If not previously cached, the client queries that network's
      Referee with the DNS name of the server (e.g., printer.internal).
      The Referee responds with the public key fingerprint of that
      server.  The client checks if the public key fingerprint (from the
      Referee) matches the public key of the server (from the TLS
      handshake).  If they match, communication with the server
      continues.  The server MAY also cache the server name and public
      key.  If they do not match, the client aborts this coummunication
      session; further actions by the client are an implementation
      detail.

   *  If previously cached, the client determines if the cached public
      key matches the public key just obtained.  If they match,
      communication continues.  If they do not match, the client aborts
      the communication; futher actions by the client are an
      implementation detail.

4.4.  Revoking Authorization

   When the administrator revoke authorization for a server (e.g.,
   replacement of a printer), the administrator removes the old public
   key from the Referee and installs the new key in the Referee.

   When this replacement occurs, the clients that have not already
   cached the server's public key will simply query the Referee, which
   has the server's new public key.  The clients that have cached the
   server's previous public key will notice the mismatch, pause their
   communication with the server, and validate with the Referee that the
   new key is legitimate, and continue their communication with the
   server.

   Thus, revoking authentication has immediate effect because the
   clients immediately validate a mismatch with the Referee.

5.  Bootstrapping the Referee

5.1.  Clients to Referee

   The clients have to be configured to trust their Referee.  This is a
   one time activity, for each home network the client joins.

   The client also uses the TLS server_certificate_type extension to
   access the Referee server itself.  This means the client has to be
   configured to trust the Referee server's public key fingerprint.

   This can be done manually or using TOFU, and is implementation
   specific.

      for discussion: To reduce initial bootstrap for client, perhaps
      use SVCB for client to bootstrap its first Referee?  This
      effectively achieves un-authenticated encryption to devices on the
      local network which is better than unencrypted traffic to those
      same devices.  For an attacker to abuse this, it requires an
      attacker advertise itself as the Referee and to maintain its
      status as Referee.

5.2.  Servers to Referee

   Server names and their associated public key fingerprints have to be
   populated into the Referee.

5.2.1.  Short Code or Scan Code

   Short code printed on the Referee-capable server which can be scanned
   by a smartphone application by the home administrator which is
   authorized to push new associations to the Referee.  Alternatively,
   the same information could be manually typed in by the home
   administrator to the Referee's management GUI or CLI.

5.2.2.  TOFU

   A client device which leans the Referee does not have an existing
   entry for a (new) name is authorized to 'push' the (new) name and its
   public key fingerprint to the Referee.

6.  Operational Notes

   The Referee has to always be available.  The client cache helps
   reduce load on the Referee but new clients (e.g., new devices, guest
   users, restored devices) and client cache invalidation will always
   cause some traffic to the Referee.

   When the Referee is unavailable, clients behavior devolves to what we
   have today: servers will need to obtain a real PKI certificate signed
   by a Certification Authority already trusted by the clients, or else
   clients will need to manually trust individual certificates.

7.  Security Considerations

   See Section 6 describing client behavior when the Referee is
   unavailable.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Register new .well_known URI for "referee".

Appendix A.  Issues for Further Discussion

A.1.  PKI Fallback

   Currently the text suggests clients should fallback to PKI if Referee
   validation fails.  But is such fallback harmful or is it worthwhile?

A.2.  Multiple Networks: Multiple Referees

   If client has multiple Referees configured (due to visiting multiple
   networks), how does client know which Referee to use for the network
   it has joined?  If SSID, wither Ethernet?  Maybe during TLS handshake
   the server could indicate the server's Referee (akin to
   [I-D.beck-tls-trust-anchor-ids]).

   If there is only one referee, this problem never occurs.

A.3.  Unique Names

   Printer.internal or printer.local are handy names.  Are they suitable
   for this system, or do we need site-specific names containing a
   unique identifier like a UUID, e.g., printer.2180be87-3e00-4c7f-
   a366-5b57fce4cbf7.internal?  Or perhaps embedding part/all of the
   public key into the name itself, for example:

     printer.2180be87-3e00-4c7f-a366-5b57fce4cbf7.internal
     nas.103a40ee-c76f-46da-84a1-054b8f18ae33.internal

   If we need unique name, we could CNAME from a convenient name
   (printer.internal) to the unique name.

A.4.  Key Lifetime (Rotating Public Key)

   If a server's raw public key changes the new key has to be installed
   into the network's Referee.

   To automate such changes, the server could communicate with the
   Referee and prove possession of its (old) private key (using TLS
   client authentication or using application-layer mechanism such as
   JSON Web Signature) to update the Referee to its new public key.
