                 A Referee to Authenticate Home Servers
                       draft-xyzzy-referee-latest

Abstract

   Obtaining and maintaining PKI certificates for devices in a home
   network is difficult for both technical and human factors reasons.
   This document describes an alternative approach to securely identify
   and authenticate home servers using a referee system.  The referee
   allows bootstrapping a network of devices by trusting only one system
   in the home network.

1.  Introduction

   Most existing TLS communications require the server obtaining a
   certificate signed by a Certification Authority trusted by the
   client.  Within a home network this is fraught with complications of
   both human factors and technical nature.

   This document describes a Referee System, where a Referee is
   entrusted (once) to help clients identify and authenticate (many)
   servers within the home network.  The Referee System purposefully
   avoids using the public key infrastructure (PKI).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Requirements Evaluation

   Using requirements from [I-D.rbw-home-servers], the proposal in this
   document has the following summarized characteristics:

    +==========+========+===========+============+==========+========+
    | Solution | Reduce | Eliminate |  Existing  | Existing | Revoke |
    |          |   CA   |     CA    | CA Support |  Client  |  Auth  |
    |          |        |           |            | Support  |        |
    +==========+========+===========+============+==========+========+
    |  Referee |  Yes   |    Yes    |    N/A     |    No    |  Yes   |
    +----------+--------+-----------+------------+----------+--------+

4.  Operation Overview

4.1.  Referee

   The Referee function is implemented within any always-on device
   within the home (e.g., router, smart home hub, NAS).  The Referee
   contains a database of local hostnames and their Referee public key
   fingerprints.

   Clients authenticate to the Referee using the TLS 'referee'
   extension.  Thus, clients wishing to participate in a 'referee'
   system need to be updated to support the TLS 'referee' extension.

   The Referee may need to revoke authorization for a server (e.g.,
   replacement of a printer).  This is accomodated by the client
   procedures which will query the Referee if the client's cached public
   key does not match the server's public key.  This revocation happens
   immediately after the Referee updates the public key associated with
   that server name.

4.2.  Servers

   A server supporting this specification is expected to be a printer
   (using IPPS or HTTPS), NAS, IoT device, router (especially its HTTPS-
   based management console or its ssh server), or similar.

   Each in-home device supporting Referee has a fixed public key, which
   persits for the lifetime of the device.  During installation of the
   device to a Referee network, the device's hostname and public key
   fingerprint are stored into the Referee Server.  Several options
   exist for this step, detailed in Section 5.

   A server supporting this specification also supports the new TLS
   ClientHello extension "referee".  Upon receiving such a ClientHello,
   the server responds with its Referee public key [RFC7250] rather than
   a PKI certificate.

      Note: if a factory reset changes the device's Referee public key,
      the new key will need to be re-enrolled with the Referee and the
      old key removed.

4.3.  Clients

   A client supporting this specification is first configured with the
   DNS name of its Referee server.  It authenticates to the Referee
   server using one of the bootstrapping mechanisms (see Section 5).
   This step occurs only once for each home network the client joins, as
   each home network is responsible for being a Referee for its own
   devices.

   When connecting to a server with an .internal domain, a client
   supporting this specification includes the TLS extension "referee" in
   its TLS ClientHello.  This causes the server to respond with its
   Referee raw public key [RFC7250] rather than a PKI certificate (which
   the client might or might not trust, based on how that PKI
   certificate was signed).

   For the client, there are two situations that may occur: it has not
   previously cached the association of hostname to public key or it has
   cached that information.

   *  If not previously cached, the client queries that network's
      Referee with the DNS name of the server (e.g., printer.internal).
      The Referee responds with the public key fingerprint of that
      server.  The client checks if the public key fingerprint (from the
      Referee) matches the public key of the server (from the TLS
      handshake).  If they match, communication with the server
      continues.  The server MAY also cache the server name and public
      key.  If they do not match, the client aborts this coummunication
      session; further actions by the client are an implementation
      detail.

   *  If previously cached, the client determines if the cached public
      key matches the public key just obtained.  If they match,
      communication continues.  If they do not match, the client aborts
      the communication; futher actions by the client are an
      implementation detail.

5.  Bootstrapping Server Public Keys to the Referee

5.1.  QR Scan

5.2.  manual entry

5.3.  TOFU

5.4.  Outstanding questions and issues

   *  Currently the text suggests clients should fallback to PKI if
      Referee validation fails.  But is such fallback harmful or is it
      worthwhile?

   *  If client has multiple Referees configured, how does client know
      which Referee to use for the network it has joined?  If SSID,
      wither Ethernet?  Maybe during TLS handshake the server could
      indicate the server's Referee??

   *  printer.internal or printer.local are handy names.  Are they
      suitable for this system, or do we need site-specific names
      containing a unique identifier like a UUID, e.g.,
      printer.2180be87-3e00-4c7f-a366-5b57fce4cbf7.internal?  If we need
      unique name, can we CNAME from printer.internal to the unique
      name?

5.5.  Operational Notes

   The Referee has to always be available.  The client cache helps
   reduce load on the Referee but new clients (e.g., new devices, guest
   users, restored devices) and client cache invalidation will always
   cause some traffic to the Referee.

   When the Referee is unavailable, clients behavior devolves to what we
   have today: servers will need to obtain a real PKI certificate signed
   by a Certification Authority already trusted by the clients, or else
   clients will need to manually trust individual certificates.

6.  Security Considerations

   See Section 5.5 describing client behavior when the Referee is
   unavailable.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Register TLS ClientHello extension "referee".
